Description: Web content engine for embedded devices - development files
 WebKit is a modern web engine that is able to display content such as
 HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It also supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest,
 XSLT, CSS, JavaScript/ECMAScript and more.
 .
 WPE WebKit is a WebKit port optimized for embedded devices and,
 unlike the GTK port, it does not depend on any particular UI toolkit
 and can be adapted to different use cases. It is designed with
 hardware acceleration in mind, leveraging common 3D graphics APIs for
 best performance.
 .
 This build provides version 2.0 of the API and uses libsoup v3 for
 the networking stack.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
